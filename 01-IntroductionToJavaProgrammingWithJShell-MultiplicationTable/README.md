## I Love Programming
- Fun
- Solving Problems


## Learning Programming
- Problem Solving Skills
- Concepts
- Language Specifics

## JShell

- Java REPL Read Eval Print Loop
- Type in one line of code (or multiple) and see output
- Makes learning Fun
- Introduced in Java 9

## Concepts
- JShell
- Statements
- Expressions
- Variables
- Literals
- If Statement
- For Loop
- Method/Function

## Multiplication Table
```
5 * 1 = 5
5 * 2 = 10
5 * 3 = 15
5 * 4 = 20
5 * 5 = 25
5 * 6 = 30
5 * 7 = 35
5 * 8 = 40
5 * 9 = 45
5 * 10 = 50
```
## Multiplication Table - Step By Step
- How to break it down?
- Where do we start?
- Calculate 5 * 5
- Print 5 * 5 = 25
- Do this 10 Times

## Naming a Variable/Method
- Combination of letters, numbers, $ and under-score(_)
- Cannot start with a number
- Cannot be a keyword
- No limit on length of identifier
- CamelCase

## Variables Types
- byte  b = 5;             //8  bits - 128 to 127
- short   s = 128;         //16 bits - 32,768 to 32,767 
- int     i = 40000;      //32 bits -  2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647
- long  l = 222222222; //64 bits -9,223,372,036,854,775,808 to 9,223,372,036,854,775,807
- float   f = 4.0f;          //32 bits NOT VERY PRECISE - don’t use for financials
- double  d = 67.0; //64 bits NOT VERY PRECISE - don’t use for financials
- char  c = 'A';             //16 bits '\u0000' to '\uffff'
- boolean isTrue = false;  //true or false
